      /*Switch Statement practice with String

    * Create class called WarmUp1_LightOnOff
    Create a variable  targetOption as String and assign one of below options  for example bd
    You have 4 switches in your home to turn on
          Bd — bedroom
          Lr  — living room
          ki  — kitchen
          Ha— Hallway
    Use switch statement to write a program to print which room light is turned on
    For example if Bd was targetOption
        then print  you have turned on bedroom light

            // what can be the data type of the variable inside switch
            // byte, short , int , char , String
